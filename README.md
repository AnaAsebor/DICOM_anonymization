# DICOM_anonymization
Python script for anonymization of images in DICOM format.  

This script is intended to serve as a tool for anonymizing DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format images using the pydicom library. 

DICOM images contain information about both the medical image itself and the associated metadata. This includes data such as patient identification, study type, date and time of acquisition, image settings, and other clinical details. The DICOM format is crucial to ensure that medical information is managed and shared effectively, maintaining the integrity and security of the data.  

This basic script is tailored to the needs of my project, but it can serve as a foundation for the development of a script customized to your requirements.
